## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation

```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install --production

# 3. Run tests
npm test

# 4. Build application
npm run build

# 5. Security audit
./scripts/security-audit.sh
```

### Step 2: Database Migration

```bash
# 1. Backup current database
./scripts/backup-database.sh

# 2. Run migrations (if any)
# Application will auto-create tables on first run

# 3. Verify database schema
psql -U spirit_tours_user -d spirit_tours_db -c "\dt"
```

### Step 3: Docker Deployment

```bash
# 1. Validate Docker setup
./scripts/validate-docker.sh

# 2. Build images
docker-compose build

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Verify services
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f

# 5. Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### Step 4: Verification

```bash
# 1. Check all services
./scripts/health-check.sh

# 2. Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/api/perspectives
curl http://localhost:3001/api/routes
curl http://localhost:3001/api/stats

# 3. Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f api

# 4. Check database connections
docker exec spirit-tours-postgres pg_isready
docker exec spirit-tours-redis redis-cli ping
```

### Step 5: DNS & SSL

```bash
# 1. Update DNS records
# Point domain to server IP

# 2. Obtain SSL certificate
